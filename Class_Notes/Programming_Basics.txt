Introduction to Programming - Basics
	Source Code: User written code in a human readable language.
	
	Byte Code: A fixed set of instructions that represents all operations like arithmetic, comparison, memory related operations etc.
		Bytecode is also referred to as P-code or Portable code. This code cannot be read by human.
		A compiler converts Source Code to Bytecode.
		Bytecode will be generated only when there is no compiler error. Ex. Say, you make a mistake in syntax, then the compilation will not be successful. Hence, there won't be bytecode generated.
		
	Machine Code: Comprises of 0's and 1's that can be understood by machines.
		An interpreter converts bytecode in to machine code.
		Machine code will not be generated if there is a runtime error. Ex. Say you have asked to print a variable that is not defined. It will lead to runtime error.
