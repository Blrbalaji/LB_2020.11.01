Adding | Committing | Pushing to GitHub

	[Local System] =  [Working Area | Staging Area | Local Repository]
	[GitHub] = [Cloud Storage]
	
	Working Area: Any file / folder at this stage is untracked. Ex. If you C & P any file into Gitrep it won't be visible on GitHub as yet.
	Objective: To Add Python Folder and all files under it.
	
	balaj@BLR-Balaji MINGW64 ~/desktop/Gitrep/LB_2020.11.01 (master) # Note that you need to be one level up i.e. in the master
	$ git add Python # This implies folder have moved from untracked to tracked area.
	
	Staging Area: Here you have to Commit the folder / files.
	$ git commit -m 'My tryst with Git | Moving Files to the Repository' # Message is a must within single quotes.
	
	$ git push # this pushes the files into the GitHub. You must now see your folders and files inside the GitHub
